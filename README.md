# MakeItRain
Make It Rain - OpenWeatherMap API project 

Release signed with apk for Deployment directly

What I would do if I have more time:

I made a mistake by trying to cache data in sharedprefs, after which changed to storing in Room. That made me lose time.

1. Mood tracker features to allow user to monitor moods according to weather
2. Improved coding conventions and practices - because I am not always coding conventionally 
3. I would have liked to spend more time on optimizing performance and improving UI/UX
4. Suggested activities feature
5. Stronger encryption for Room DB
